DESCRIPTION

chunk is a simple program for reading and writing data, with the ability
to specify a starting offset position in the input, a seek position in
the output, and a maximum length of bytes to copy. This program may be
considered similar to dd, but the positions are exact and not dependent
on the block size of data copied. It also buffers a large amount of
data with each read and write to make the copy more efficient.

CHANGES

0.00 - 2005-10-13
	- Changed byte indicators to use ssize_t to allow larger
	  positions and lengths.

0.01 - 2017-12-23
	- Added the -b option to dynamically allocate the buffer.
	- First publicly released version.

0.02 - 2018-02-03
	- Reverted a bug that incorrectly set and compared the length.
	- Changed input parameters to use size_t for larger values.
	- Changed total size to unsigned to prevent infinite loops.

0.03 - 2020-02-02
	- Added the -s option to seek a position in the output file.
	- Do not truncate the output file when seek is used.

0.04 - 2020-02-29
	- Added the -e option to set the ending offset position to
	  calculate the length of bytes to copy.
