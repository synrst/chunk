.SH NAME
.PP
chunk - Copies a chunk of data as specified by the offset and length.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
chunk [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a simple program for reading and writing data, with the ability
to specify a starting offset position and a maximum length.
.PP
It will start reading the first byte at position 0 by default.
If the starting offset position is set with the \f[B]-p\f[] option, it
will skip the specified bytes by using lseek() (if and when supported)
to jump to that position in the input, or by reading and discarding the
specified number of bytes.
.PP
If the input continues to provide data, it will continue to read and
write data until end-of-file (EOF) is reached.
If the maximum length is set with the \f[B]-l\f[] option, it will read
at most the specified number of bytes from the starting offset position.
If there are less bytes in the input, it will only read the data that
is available up until EOF.
.PP
The internal buffer used to read and write data is allocated at program
runtime.
The default size of this buffer is 256 KB, and can be changed to an
exact value with the \f[B]-b\f[] option.
.PP
The default input file is STDIN and the default output file is STDOUT.
These can be changed with the \f[B]-f\f[] and \f[B]-o\f[] options
respectively.
.PP
This program also supports hexadecimal values for the parameters.
Any of the numeric parameters can be prepended with \f[B]0x\f[] to
indicate that the value is hexadecimal.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -p \f[I]offset\f[]
Sets the starting offset position to begin reading data.
The default is 0, indicating that it will start at the beginning.
Hexadecimal values prepended with \f[B]0x\f[] are valid.
Suffixes are not supported, so the value must be exact.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -l \f[I]length\f[]
Sets the maximum length of bytes to copy.
The default is -1, indicating that it will read data until EOF.
Hexadecimal values prepended with \f[B]0x\f[] are valid.
Suffixes are not supported, so the value must be exact.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -f \f[I]file_in\f[]
Sets the input file.
The default is STDIN.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -o \f[I]file_out\f[]
Sets the output file.
The default is STDOUT.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B -b \f[I]buf_size\f[]
Sets the buffer size.
The default is 262144 bytes.
Hexadecimal values prepended with \f[B]0x\f[] are valid.
Suffixes are not supported, so the value must be exact.
